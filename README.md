## What is Data Storytelling?

Data storytelling is a method of conveying insights and findings from data analysis in a compelling and easily understandable narrative form. It combines data analysis with elements of storytelling to make data-driven insights more accessible and impactful to a broader audience, including non-technical individuals.

## Data Analysis

Our analysis delves deep into the data to provide a comprehensive understanding of Manchester United's EPL journey. We cover various aspects, including:

- Season-wise performance: A year-by-year breakdown of the club's performance, from title-winning seasons to transitional periods.
- Top points: The players who left an indelible mark by finding the back of the net.
- Trophies won: A recount of the silverware accumulated during the club's EPL history.

## Tactics to create a story

- **Data Sources:** Begin by collecting relevant data from trustworthy sources such as official sports statistics websites, databases, or APIs. For our project, we'll focus on EPL data.

- **Data Frame Preparation:** Organize the data into a structured data frame, ensuring consistency and accuracy. Handle missing data and outliers appropriately to maintain data quality.

- **Identify Key Metrics:** Determine the key metrics or aspects you want to explore. In our case, we'll look at Manchester United's performance, top goal-scorers, managerial transitions, iconic matches, and trophies won in the EPL and qualify for UEFA.

- **Visual Aids:** Select the most suitable charts, graphs, and visualizations to represent your data effectively. Different aspects may require different types of visuals.

- **Structure Your Story:** Create a clear narrative structure, starting with an engaging introduction and following a storyline. We'll use a structured approach, similar to the three-act structure: setup, conflict, and resolution.

- **Provide Context:** Annotate visualizations and provide explanations to help your audience understand the data. Explain why the data is relevant and what it reveals.

- **Highlight Key Findings:** Showcase the most interesting insights and trends you've discovered during the analysis. For example, we'll delve into Manchester United's iconic points, won, and legendary goals.
  
- **Visual Harmony:** Pay attention to the design elements. Ensure consistency in colors, fonts, and layout to create a visually appealing story.

- **Focusing on Relevance:** Avoid information overload. Concentrate on the most important and relevant data to maintain the audience's engagement.

- **User Engagement:** If possible, add interactive elements to your visualization to allow users to explore the data themselves and draw their conclusions.

- **Connect with Your Audience:** Use anecdotes, case studies, or personal experiences to create an emotional connection with your audience.

- **Guiding Your Audience:** If applicable, conclude your data story with a clear call to action. What should the audience do with the insights you've provided?

- **Feedback and Improvements:** Share your work with colleagues or friends to get feedback. Be open to making improvements as data storytelling is an iterative process.
